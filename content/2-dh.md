## Defining Digital Humanities

As you create your multimedia essay for this course, you will be engaging in the fields of Digital Humanities and Digital History.

At its most general, Digital Humanities can be defined as the process of utilizing technology to ask (and answer) traditional humanities questions in new ways.
Digital History is this process applied specifically to History. 

This definition is necessarily vague, as digital research in History can range from asking traditional humanities-oriented questions about digital media and computing technologies, to using computational tools and methods to investigate historical data.
(To show just how wide-ranging definitions of Digital Humanities can be, follow this link and refresh the page to view the creative and varying definitions that Digital Humanists have come up with to define what they do: <https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/>{:target='_blank'})

Because of this, Digital Humanities projects can take a variety of forms.
Take a few minutes to explore two or three Digital Humanities projects recently nominated for the 2020 Digital Humanities Awards: <http://dhawards.org/dhawards2020/results/>.

Most importantly, when we engage in Digital Humanities and Digital History projects, it is not to *replace* traditional humanities research methods.
Rather, the digital tools we use can *extend* the possibilities of deep thinking and criticism that characterize the humanities.

In the case of this class, we'll be extending our understanding of 20th century American history by performing computational analyses on and visualizing patterns in historical texts (20th century State of the Union Addresses and Party Platform texts, to be exact), and communicating our findings via the digital medium of a web essay. 

> The logical question at this point might be, "Why do we need to do this?"

And the answer is we don't necessarily *need* to do it--it's true that you might not discover anything useful from our analyses or visualizations and decide that you never want to dabble in Digital History again, and that's fine!

However, we *are* going to do it in this course for the following reasons:
1. To introduce you to methods of gaining information from--and determining patterns across--large collections of primary resources when you don't have time to read them all (consider: over the course of the 20th century there are a total of 103 State of the Union Addresses and 57 Party Platform statements!). Of course, you'll want to read some of them, but taken as a whole the data outputs and visualizations can become another resource for you along with the primary and secondary sources you gather as you form arguments and opinions about the events and people that shaped 20th century American history.
2. To introduce you to the experience of writing for the web in a professional way. What you do with your multimedia essay after the course ends is up to you--but even if you choose never to make your essay publicly findable or even choose to delete it, during this class you will gain the experience of writing an essay in a space other than a Microsoft Word Document and integrating resources such as supporting images and documents into the text, an activity that can open up possibilities for creativity that aren't always present in a typical term paper.
3. To introduce some real-world technical concepts and skills in a fun, low-stakes way. In this class we'll be utilizing the popular web platform GitHub, where developers all over the world collaborate on projects and code, to store our files and create our websites. Rest assured, though, we will be doing ***no coding*** in this course! But you will walk away with some very basic real-world skills (i.e. familiarity with spreadsheets, Markdown, and GitHub) that just might come in handy some day in your future.

In sum, the best advice I can give you is to approach this project with an open mind.
We're not expecting you to become experts in Digital Humanities methods over the course of this semester, but we are asking that you give these tools a try because you just might walk away with a valuable new insight or skill.

## Getting Started

We need to introduce three concepts before we can get started:

1. Text as Data
2. Text Analysis
3. Topic Modeling

### Text as Data

In this course, we 
Usually when people analyze text, they are interested in words (i.e. word frequency, order, etc.).

Breaking down a text into smaller units of analysis lets us see patterns and approach from different points of entry.


1. Data
- We need data to analyze. In our case, our data is composed of texts: State of the Union Addresses and Party Platforms. These texts have already been prepared for your use, as individual text files and in spreadsheet format (more on this next week)
2. Analysis



### Text Analysis

### Topic Modeling
