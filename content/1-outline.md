# Text analysis content for course

1. Brief intro to text analysis / topic modeling
    - Tools:
        - Voyant: <https://voyant-tools.org/>
        - jsLDA: <https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/>
2. Explanation of what we are doing and why
3. Do GitHub tutorial (get account, make a commit, copy a template, etc.), <https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-0-github>
4. Do Markdown tutorial (create a heading, create a paragraph, create a list, create bold/italicized text, etc.), <https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-2-markdown>
5. Copy project template: <https://github.com/learn-static/text-analysis>
    - project template contains: prepared 20th century SOTU data, a collection of individual SOTUs (so full text can be read/linked to), blank pages for future student essays, code for including visualizations
6. Turn on GitHub Pages to get website up and running (learned in GitHub tutorial above)
7. Visualizing topics with prepared data
    - Introduce the data (state of the union addresses)
    - Find prepared topic data in copied project template
    - Follow instructions (instructions will include step by step documentation plus an example essay structure to emulate) to produce a set number of visualizations and write about them

## Additional possibilities:
- Follow steps to run topic modeling either on SOTUs or Party Platforms (both included in repository)
- Follow steps to create and embed Voyant visualizations
